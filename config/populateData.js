    'motto': 'Act now to help us create a flourishing food forest in desertified Andalusia.',
    'description':
    `THE ISSUE 
With over one third of the world’s land threatened by desertification, something needs to change now. This devastating process is caused by intense agricultural farming, overgrazing, deforestation and soil erosion.It turns land that was once fertile and productive into dry and desolate areas. Desertification is quickly becoming more apparent in multiple landscapes across the world.Where plant and animal life was once flourishing, they are now struggling to survive.
 
Southern Spain is at high risk of becoming a desert if these harmful agricultural practices continue. Over 30% of Spain’s landmass is already affected by desertification, particularly here in Andalusia, in the south of Spain. The land has become less and less fertile and with such an ingrained farming culture, it is only getting worse. Higher temperatures each year and more frequent droughts are reducing water availability, crop productivity and soil capacity.

THE SOLUTION
 
Desertification can be prevented through appropriate rainwater harvesting, reforestation and soil regeneration.
 
It is possible to turn this situation around and reverse desertification. We must go back to working with nature.
 
With your help we will transform land that is rapidly becoming desert into a productive food forest, using natural techniques. We will facilitate bigger grass roots change, through inspiring and educating other farmers. As a non-profit educational driver of change, we plan to share our success story through as many channels as possible to inspire a wider community.
 
Join us in creating an inspiring model of a flourishing and abundant edible food forest!
 
In the last few years we have been regenerating the land, creating edible gardens and planting hundreds of trees. Our huge next step is to create an entire food forest which will not only save the soil but also be an abundantly productive example of what is possible for years to come. By planting a huge range of fruit trees, shrubs, vegetation and herbs we will be nourishing the soil with a diverse mix of life-saving nutrients. Our land will provide a template for other farmers around the area to see as a productive alternative to industrial agriculture.

Danyadara is currently funded solely on donations and is a volunteer based enterprise, putting all funds back into the land. We need your help to raise money to turn our dry and barren seven hectare wheat field into an abundant food forest!
 
WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?
 
The money raised will jumpstart the food forest over the next two years.
bove: The huge 7 hectare wheat field we will transform into the food forest.
 
50% of the funds will go directly to a whole variety of trees, seeds, shrubs and edible plants and herbs. 
 
25% of the funds will be spent implementing a water system that will collect rainwater in the winter for us to use all year round, solving the drought issues we face during dry summer months.
 
The remaining 25% will go towards creating an amazing greenhouse. This will provide the perfect environment for our little seedlings throughout the year and be home to a variety of plants that we may not be able to grow otherwise. 
 
During the next two years we will spend our time cultivating, planting, researching and developing ways to produce the best results. We want to expand our horizons and offer more to the local community and international followers. We will to continue to run permaculture courses and expand our online educational resources.
 
But we won’t stop there. Our project will last for lifetimes and provide an inspiring example of positive change that will awaken and motivate others for generations to come.
 
 
MAKING A DIFFERENCE
 
With your generosity we will reap abundant productivity from the land, cultivate a diversity of plants and seasonal food, create employment opportunities for local people, and implement positive and lasting change.
 
Regenerating our land will demonstrate that it’s not only possible to stop desertification but to produce an abundance of food on land that was rapidly turning barren. We want to educate and motivate the region, by offering an outstanding model to follow.`,

    'video': 'https://youtu.be/fcC0GCdpmHg',
    'motto': 'We are helping Christians in Iraq',
    'description':
    `The Rebel News Network Ltd. is going to the refugee camps in Northern Iraq to see the Christian refugees, ancient Christians, called Chaldean Christians, who still pray in Aramaic, the language of Jesus himself.

They’re fleeing ISIS — Muslim terrorists who kill Christian men and rape Christian women and girls as young as nine years old.

This is a jihad, a Muslim holy war against Christians.
 
Why are we in Iraq?
 
To do the reporting nobody else will.
 
We always hear about Muslim refugees. But no-one is committing a genocide against Muslims. There are 50 Muslim countries in the world. But Christians are being ethnically cleansed throughout the middle east. That gets a tiny fraction of the media attention, and none of the political attention. Why? Because they’re Christian.
 
Who will save the Christians?
 
We will do our part. I’m bringing a team with me. Faith Goldy, the outstanding investigative journalist, passionate Christian. And three videographers. We’re going to do this right.

We’re going to tell the story that hasn’t properly been told yet: the deliberate ethnic cleansing of the oldest Christian community in the world — in the Biblical land of Nineveh. By the Islamic State.

We want to tell the story journalistically — we’ll give updates from the ground. But we also want to make a world-class documentary film, of a quality that we could distribute through a major network.
 
How can you help?
 
We’re bringing thousands of dollars worth of food hampers for the camp — enough to provide for 750 families. It’s going to cost us approximately $10,000 US dollars. But that's not all. 
 
I want to raise a million dollars for whoever is making the biggest difference on the ground. But I want to see it with my own eyes and make sure the cheque isn't being embezzled or wasted. 
 
Can we really raise a million?
 
I know that sounds nuts. But it shouldn’t be. That’s how much money the UN spends every two hours on Muslim refugees from the region — and they’re not facing a genocide.
 
The Christians who are stranded in the region — they can’t even go to the UN-run refugee camps, because they are attacked there too, by Muslim extremists.
 
Muslim refugees are well taken care of — by the UN, by Angela Merkel, by Justin Trudeau, by the media.
 
www.SaveTheChristians.com
 
So we’re launching this crowdfunding site to take care of the forgotten ones. Will you please help us?

If not you, then who? And if not now, then when?
 
Let’s see if we can save one life. Or maybe, if we can raise a million dollars, let's see if we can help save hundreds of lives. Let’s see if we can help save this Christian community from genocide.
 
If you want to donate by cheque, via snail mail, do that too!
Just put "Save the Christians" in the memo section and make the cheque payable to:
For Canada
PO Box 61056 Eglinton/Dufferin RO
Toronto, ON M6E 5B2
 
*ForCanada is a pre-existing non-profit organization co-founded by Ezra Levant to raise money for charitable causes. 
 
*This fundraiser is in USD. This is because the Generosity platform can only accept USD and many of the potential organizations in Iraq which we will donate to, may only accept USD.`,

    'motto': 'Taiz zoo was abandoned',
    'description':
    `Due to the worsening war in Yemen, Taiz zoo was abandoned and the 265 remaining animals, such as lions (17 plus two cubs!), leopards (26 plus two cubs) and others were starving. 11 lions and 6 leopards had already died. SOS has stepped in on February 12 to turn the situation around. We have succeeded, but each day is a new challenge.
    
    These starving animals need your help. We need per day: meat at least 280 kg USD 350, 5.000 L cleaning water transport plus purchase of drinking water, plus veterinarians and medical care, payment of six zoo workers including a butcher, and an SOS zoo coordinator and field supervisor who is at the zoo six days/week. So minimum USD 3300/week plus special needs. Including costs for the herbivore and bird food (which the Yemen government stopped paying in September), the total is over usd 4.000/week. Since September, most of that has been covered by A Lion's Heart, whilst SOS continued to cover usd 3300/week. 
 
    Due to the war and the lack of perspective for the zoo,  animal organizations are still not active in the area. We, the SOS Zoo and Bear Rescue group (Facebook) have a service agreement with Tamdeen Youth Foundation, who are based in Taiz and experienced in running projects for UN and WFP.  Since February 12, SOS has supported the zoo with the above. Two SOS people from Tamdeen are working daily in and with the zoo. We need time to find a local solution, as the animals can't leave the zoo or Yemen. We need to keep them alive. We urgently need more funds for water, food, veterinary care, ongoing care. Please DONATE NOW! Any amount will help to make a difference.`,

    'motto': '7.8-magnitude earthquake hit the coast of Ecuador',
    'description':
    `
On Saturday, April 16th at 6:58pm, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit the coast of Ecuador and has since generated over 700 aftershocks between the cities of Pedernales and Cojimies (north of the coastal province of Manabí). With 655 deaths, some 4,600 injured, and 41 still missing over a week after the quake—not to mention 29,000 people displaced and billions in damage—the reconstruction efforts in Ecuador will take many months, if not years, and the sustainability of reconstruction means capitalizing on immediate support while aiming to sustain international attention.
 
The Global Shapers Quito Hub, a group of young people chosen for their ability to generate change, launched a crowd funding campaign on April 17th to gather support from the national and international community. Our initial goal was to raise $8,000, but with overwhelmingly strong and generous support from a global community, we surpassed $100K within days. We are committed to investing ourselves fully to this campaign with the intention to fundraise for a full month. 
 
We are working alongside the Ecuadorian Red Cross and the National Government to determine national priorities. Our goal is to sustain national and international engagement to support relief efforts beyond peak emergency response. Gathering lessons from the Haiti and Nepali Earthquake response, we are committed to doing our part in maintaining donor engagement and following through from emergency alleviation assistance to deeper reconstruction efforts.
 
Given the magnitude of this crisis and the widespread support we have received from our donors abroad, we are committed to ensuring we are maximizing contributions. Transparency and monitoring of funds will be of the highest priority for our team. It is our goal to come in as a "second wave" of funding—activities to be determined following official assessments of the damage in the coastal region. We will update you on emerging priorities as this information becomes available.
 
Please contribute to our campaign and share among your contacts!
 
We need you to be our ripple effect.`,

    'description':
    `Our mission at George Mark Children’s House (www.georgemark.org) is to help critically ill children and their families by providing medical and hospice care in our life-affirming and nurturing environment.  Our services are free of charge to our families, but because we receive little or no reimbursement for our services from the insurance industry and government we rely almost exclusively on donations to support our operations.  Unfortunately, we occasionally have to turn away patients who are severely underinsured or have no insurance.  We’ve started a Fund-a-Bed Campaign to raise $288,000 to underwrite the cost of two of our eight patient beds allowing us to accept any patient regardless of his/her insurance status.  Please consider making a donation today to help make this possible!
    
    To quote Kathy, the mother of Charlie, one of our patients:  “With the help of George Mark our whole family is able to live the best quality of life possible.  George Mark changed the quality of life for our family; it changed Charlie’s life, and the quality of our marriage.  Now, Charlie knows there are people in his life other than his family that he can depend on.”`,

    'description':
    `Rhinos continued to be slaughtered at an alarming rate in South Africa and some desperate rhino owners cannot get rid of the survivors fast enough.  Traumatised and disheartened, still reeling with shock caused by the brutality of these poaching incidents rhino owners will in most instances accept the first available offer to buy their remaining rhinos.
 
There is a new-breed rhino buyer and they see themselves as Rhino-Speculators although they are in effect animal traders.
 
While many people feel deeply for rhinos and what the animals have suffered and continue to endure, there are also animal traders that see these animals as nothing more than a commercial opportunity.
 
In most instances where poaching has taken place, the remaining rhinos on private properties normally have their horns intact and this presents Rhino-Speculators with the ideal opportunity to double up on their investments as animal traders.
 
They will purchase the surviving rhinos, relocate them to an interim location where the animals are summarily de-horned and then sold on to the next buyer. 
 
Rhino horns do grow back and eventually it will be possible to de-horn the rhino again in a year or two.
 
Milk dependent rhino calves are separated from their mothers at the age of 12 - 24 months and many of them are sold and exported to countries such as Vietnam and China.
 
Unofficially more than 600 rhinos have already died at the hands of poachers in South Africa since 1 January 2017 to date.  Shockingly the government is yet to release official statistics for 2017. 
 
When we heard about Azi and his Mamma's plight we secured a purchase agreement with the animal trader so that they can be relocated to an Intensive Protection Zone where they can remain together and live the life they deserve.
 
Here Azi ‘s Mamma will have the pleasure of seeing her young calf grow into a healthy white rhino bull instead of having to endure yet another loss when her calf is removed from her.  Here both rhinos will be able to build social bonds with their own kind that will help them to overcome their emotional trauma sustained from the poaching incident and the subsequent capture, relocation and dehorning.
 
Please get involved and help us to help these two amazing rhinos!`,
